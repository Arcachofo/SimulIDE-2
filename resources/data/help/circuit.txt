Circuit:

Property: (default value)

- Speed sps: (1000000)
   Simulation speed in Steps per Second.

- Speed per: (100)
   Simulation speed in percentage %. 

- Simu Step nS: (1000)
   Simulation step in nanoSeconds.

- ReactStep: (50)
   Run Reactive components once every simulation steps.

- NoLinAcc: (5)
   Non-Linear components accuracy. Higher is more accurate.

- Show Grid: (true)

- Show Scrollbar: (false)

- Animate: (false)
   Wires will get Red if Volts>2.5, Blue otherwise.

- Font Scale: (1)
   Scale interface font, for example 1,5 = 150%.

- Auto Backup Secs: (15)
   Time interval in seconds for Circuit to check for changes.
   Save Circuit backup if there are changes.
   Setting time to 0 disables Auto Backup.
