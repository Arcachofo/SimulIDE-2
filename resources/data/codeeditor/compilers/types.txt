Compiler types:

For generic compilers, the type field ( for example type="asm01" ) defines certain characteristics.
The key is in the last 2 numeric digits ( for example "01" ).
From left to right:
    
- First ( for example "0*" ) language level: 
    0 for asm, 1 for high level
    
- Second digit digit ( for example "*1" ) lst file type: 
    Bit0: use ":" ?
        0 doesn't use ":" (gpasm ).
        1 uses ":" (avra, gavrasm)
    
    Bit1: position of flash address  (0 or 1)
